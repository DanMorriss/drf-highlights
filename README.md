## Database Schema

![Database schema](docs/database_schema.png)

- To create a new app for a new model  
`python manage.py startapp <appname>`  
Then add it to the `INTALLED_APPS` list in settings.py

- To migrate the changes to the database  
`python manage.py makemigrations`  
`python manage.py migrate`

- To create a superuser  
`python manage.py createsuperuser`

## Technologies Used

- A full list of the requirements and the versions used can be found in the requirements.txt file.  
The requirements.txt file can be created/updated by running the following command:  
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

- To install them and run them on your own machine first setup a virtual environment with the command to create a venv...  
`python3 -m venv venv`  
Then this command to run the venv run the command  
`source venv/bin/activate`  
To stop running the environment simply type the command  
`deactivate`  
To install the requirements use the command, make sure your venv is activated  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Validation & Testing

- All files were passed through the [Code Institute PEP8 Validation Tool](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) and came back with no errors, with the exception of some lines being too long in settings.py. As these were URL's and could not be shortened I decided to leave them in.
- Both Unit and Manual Testing were completed.

- For details on testing see the [Testing File](TESTING.md)

## Bugs

- I had a circular import between highlight and location. Removing the highlight import fixed the issue. I also had to allow the field to be null as there are some highlights that do not have a location.

## Project Setup

1. Use the [Code Institute Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) to create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Install Django Rest Framework with the following command
    - `pip3 install 'django<4'`
3. Initialize the project with the following command
    - `django-admin startproject drf_highlights .`
4. Install Django Cloudinary Storage for image storage with the following command
    - `pip install django-cloudinary-storage`
5. Install Pillow for image processing with the following command
    - `pip install Pillow`
6. Add `cloudinary` and `cloudinary_storage` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py with `django.contrib.staticfiles` between them
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage', 
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
]
```
7. Create an env.py file in the base directory and add `import os` at the top, then add the cloudinary API Environment variable
```
import os

os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = '<Cloudinary API Environment variable>'
```
8. Back in settings.py 
    - add import os and env.py (if it it present)
    - set `CLOUDINARY_STORAGE` to the `CLOUDINARY_URL`
    - set `MEDIA_URL` so the settings knows where to put the image files
    - set the `DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE` to `cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage`
```
import os

if os.path.exists('env.py'):
    import env

CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
    'CLOUDINARY_URL': os.environ.get('CLOUDINARY_URL')
}
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

## Deployment

### Setup JSON Web Tokens

1. install JSON Web Token authentication run terminal command:  
`pip install dj-rest-auth==2.1.9`
2. Add 'rest_framework.authtoken' and 'dj_rest_auth' to the list of INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py as below:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'cloudinary_storage',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'cloudinary',
    'location_field.apps.DefaultConfig',
    'rest_framework',
    'django_filters',
    'rest_framework.authtoken',
    'dj_rest_auth',
    ...
]
```
3. Add the dj-rest-auth urls paths to the main urls.py file as below:
```
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api-auth/', include('rest_framework.urls')),
    path('dj-rest-auth/', include('dj_rest_auth.urls')),
    ...
]
```
4. Migrate the database with terminal command:  
`python manage.py migrate`

5. For users to be able to register, install Django AllAuth with terminal command:  
`pip install 'dj-rest-auth[with_social]'`

6. Add the following INSTALLED_APPS to settings.py:  
```
    'django.contrib.sites',
    'allauth',
    'allauth.account',
    'allauth.socialaccount',
    'dj_rest_auth.registration',
```
7. Set SITE_ID in settings.py to 1:  
`SITE_ID = 1`

8. Add the registration urls below to the main urls.py file:  
```
    path(
        'dj-rest-auth/registration/', include('dj_rest_auth.registration.urls')
    ),
```

9. To install the JSON tokens, run terminal command:  
`pip install djangorestframework-simplejwt`

10. Set DEV to 1 in the env.py file:  
`os.environ['DEV'] = '1'`

11. This value can be used to check if project is in development or production. Add the following if/else statement to settings.py:
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [(
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication'
        if 'DEV' in os.environ
        else 'dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication'
    )],
}
```

12. - To enable token authentication, set REST_USE_JWT to True.  
    - To ensure tokens are sent over HTTPS only, set JWT_AUTH_SECURE to True.  
    - Cookie names must also be declared. To do all of this, add the following code below the if/else statement just added to settings.py:
```
REST_USE_JWT = True
JWT_AUTH_SECURE = True
JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'
JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE = 'my-refresh-token'
```

13. Create serializers.py file in the main app directory (drf_highlights), and copy UserDetailsSerializer code from Django documentation as follows:
```
from dj_rest_auth.serializers import UserDetailsSerializer
from rest_framework import serializers


class CurrentUserSerializer(UserDetailsSerializer):
    profile_id = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='profile.id')
    profile_image = serializers.ReadOnlyField(source='profile.image.url')

    class Meta(UserDetailsSerializer.Meta):
        fields = UserDetailsSerializer.Meta.fields + (
            'profile_id', 'profile_image'
        )
```

14. Overwrite the default user detail serializer in settings.py with the following:  
```
REST_AUTH_SERIALIZERS = {
    'USER_DETAILS_SERIALIZER': 'drf_highlights.serializers.CurrentUserSerializer'
}
```

15. Migrate the database again with command:  
`python manage.py migrate`

16. Update requirements.txt file with new dependencies by running command:  
`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

17. Add, commit and push changes.

### Prepare API for deployment to Heroku

1. To add a custom message to the root_route, create a views.py file in the drf_highlights directory and add the following code:
```
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response


@api_view()
def root_route(request):
    return Response({
        "message": "Welcome to The Highlights DRF API!"
    })
```

2. Import it into the main urls.py file, and add the following to the top of the urlpatterns list:  
```
from .views import root_route

urlpatterns = [
    path('', root_route),
    ...
]
```

3. To set up page pagination, inside settings.py add the following to REST_FRAMEWORK:  
```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [(
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication'
        if 'DEV' in os.environ
        else 'dj_rest_auth.jwt_auth.JWTCookieAuthentication'
    )],
    'DEFAULT_PAGINATION_CLASS':
    'rest_framework.pagination.PageNumberPagination',
    'PAGE_SIZE': 10,
}
```

4. Set the default renderer to JSON for the production environment. In settings.py add the following:  
```
if 'DEV' not in os.environ:
    REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_RENDERER_CLASSES'] = [
        'rest_framework.renderers.JSONRenderer',
    ]
```

5. To set up DATETIME_FORMAT, add the following to settings.py (inside REST_FRAMEWORK, under PAGE_SIZE):  
```
'DATETIME_FORMAT': '%d %b %y',
```

6. To show how long ago a comment was created, set DATETIME format inside the serializers.py file within the comments app:  
```
from django.contrib.humanize.templatetags.humanize import naturaltime

created_on = serializers.SerializerMethodField()
updated_on = serializers.SerializerMethodField()

    def get_created_on(self, obj):
        """Method to display when comment was posted"""
        return naturaltime(obj.created_on)

    def get_updated_on(self, obj):
        """Method to display when comment was updated"""
        return naturaltime(obj.updated_on)

```

7. Add, commit and push changes.

### Deploy to ElephantSQL

1. Log into ElephantSQL and create a new instance.

2. Select the free plan.

3. Select a local region.

4. Click on 'Create Instance'

5. Back on the dashboard click on the instance you just created.

6. In the URL section, click the copy icon to copy the database URL.

### Create a Heroku app

1. Log into Heroku.

2. Create a new app.

3. Go to 'Settings', click on 'Reveal Config Vars' and add the ElephantSQL DATABASE_URL (without any quotes).

4. In the terminal, install dj_database_url and psycopg2, both of these are needed to connect to your external database: 
`pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2`

5. In your settings.py file, import dj_database_url underneath the import for os:
```
import os
import dj_database_url
```

6. Update the DATABASES section to the following:
```
if 'DEV' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
```  
This will ensure that when you have an environment variable for DEV in your environment the code will connect to the sqlite database here in your IDE. Otherwise it will connect to your external database, provided the DATABASE_URL environment variable exist.

7. In your env.py file, add a new environment variable with the key set to DATABASE_URL, and the value to your ElephantSQL database URL:
```
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "<your PostgreSQL URL here>"
```  
Remember to add quotes as this needs to be a string.

8. Temporarily comment out the DEV environment variable so that your IDE can connect to your external database:
```
import os

os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = "cloudinary://..."
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "Z7o..."
# os.environ['DEV'] = '1'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "postgres://..."
```

9. Back in your settings.py file, add a print statement to confirm you have connected to the external database
```
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
    }
    print('connected')
```

10. In the terminal, -–dry-run your makemigrations to confirm you are connected to the external database:  
`python3 manage.py makemigrations --dry-run`  
If you are, you should see the ‘connected’ message printed to the terminal.

11. Remove the print statement.

12. Migrate your database models to your new database:
`python3 manage.py migrate`\

13. Create a superuser for your new database:
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

### Confirm the migration

1. On the ElephantSQL page for your database, in the left side navigation, select “BROWSER”

2. Click the Table queries button, select auth_user

3. When you click “Execute”, you should see your newly created superuser details displayed. This confirms your tables have been created and you can add data to your database.

### Prepare Project for deployment to Heroku

1. In the terminal of your IDE workspace, install gunicorn
`pip3 install gunicorn django-cors-headers`

2. Update your requirements.txt
`pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`

3. Heroku also requires a `Procfile`. Create this file now. Remember, it must be named correctly and not have any file extension, otherwise Heroku won’t recognise it

4. Inside the Procfile, add these two commands
```
release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate
web: gunicorn drf_highlights.wsgi
```  
Save the file.

5. In your settings.py file, update the value of the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable to include your Heroku app’s URL
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '<your_app_name>.herokuapp.com']
```

6. Add corsheaders to INSTALLED_APPS:
```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'dj_rest_auth.registration',
    'corsheaders',
    ...
]
```

7. Add corsheaders middleware to the TOP of the MIDDLEWARE:
```
MIDDLEWARE = [
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
    ...
]
```

8. Under the MIDDLEWARE list, set the ALLOWED_ORIGINS for the network requests made to the server with the following code:
```
if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
        os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN')
    ]
else:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
        r"^https://.*\.gitpod\.io$",
    ]
```  
Here the allowed origins are set for the network requests made to the server. The API will use the CLIENT_ORIGIN variable, which is the front end app's url. We haven't deployed that project yet, but that's ok. If the variable is not present, that means the project is still in development, so then the regular expression in the else statement will allow requests that are coming from your IDE.

9. Enable sending cookies in cross-origin requests so that users can get authentication functionality
```
else:
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
        r"^https://.*\.gitpod\.io$",
    ]

CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS = True
```

10. To be able to have the front end app and the API deployed to different platforms, set the JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE attribute to 'None'. Without this the cookies would be blocked.
```
JWT_AUTH_COOKIE = 'my-app-auth'
JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKE = 'my-refresh-token'
JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE = 'None'
```

11. Remove the value for SECRET_KEY and replace with the following code to use an environment variable instead.
```
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
```

12. Set a NEW value for your SECRET_KEY environment variable in env.py, do NOT use the same one that has been published to GitHub in your commits  
[Django Secret Key Generator](https://djecrety.ir/)  
```
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "CreateANEWRandomValueHere")
```

13. Set the DEBUG value to be True only if the DEV environment variable exists. This will mean it is True in development, and False in production.
```
DEBUG = 'DEV' in os.environ
```

14. Comment DEV back in env.py
```
import os

os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = "cloudinary://..."
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = "Z7o..."
os.environ['DEV'] = '1'
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = "postgres://..."
```

15. Ensure the project requirements.txt file is up to date. In the IDE terminal of your DRF API project enter the following:
`pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`

16. Add, commit and push your code to GitHub

### Deploying to Heroku

1. Back on the Heroku dashboard for your new app, open the Settings tab.

2. Add two more Config Vars:
    - SECRET_KEY (you can make one up, but don’t use the one that was originally in the settings.py file!)
    - CLOUDINARY_URL, and for the value, copy in your Cloudinary URL from your env.py file (do not add quotation marks!)
    - You should already have DATABASE_URL (postgress) and DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC (set to 1)

3. Open the Deploy tab.

4. In the Deployment method section, select Connect to GitHub.

5. Search for your repo and click Connect

6. Optional: You can click Enable Automatic Deploys in case you make any further changes to the project. This will trigger any time code is pushed to your GitHub repository

7. Under Manual deploy click `Deploy Branch`

8. Your app should be successfully deployed to Heorku. If there was an error and you need to view your logs log in to heroku with the following command:  
`heroku login`  
Then to view the logs:  
`heroku logs --tail --app drf-highlights`

### Fix the dj-rest-auth issue with logging out

1. In drf_highlights/views.py, import JWT_AUTH settings from settings.py.
```
from .settings.responses import (
    JWT_AUTH_COOKIE,
    JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKE,
    JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE,
    JWT_AUTH_SECURE
)
```

2. Write a logout view. That sets the value of both the access token (JWT_AUTH_COOKIE) and refresh token (JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKIE) to empty strings. We also pass samesite=JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE, which we set to ’None’ in settings.py and make sure the cookies are httponly and sent over HTTPS
```
# dj-rest-auth logout view fix
@api_view(['POST'])
def logout_route(request):
    response = Response()
    response.set_cookie(
        key=JWT_AUTH_COOKIE,
        value='',
        httponly=True,
        expires='Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT',
        max_age=0,
        samesite=JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE,
        secure=JWT_AUTH_SECURE
    )
    response.set_cookie(
        key=JWT_AUTH_REFRESH_COOKE,
        value='',
        httponly=True,
        expires='Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT',
        max_age=0,
        samesite=JWT_AUTH_SAMESITE,
        secure=JWT_AUTH_SECURE
    )
    return response
```

3. Now that the logout view is there, it has to be included in drf_api/urls.py . The logout_route also needs to be imported.
Inside drf_highlights/urls.py add the following import:
```
from .views import route_route, logout_route
```

4. ... and then included in the urlpatterns list. The important thing to note here is that our logout_route has to be placed above the default dj-rest-auth urls, so that it is matched first.
```
urlpatterns = [
    ...
    # our logout route has to be above the default one to be matched first
    path('dj-rest-auth/logout/', logout_route),
    path('dj-rest-auth/', include('dj_rest_auth.urls')),
    ...
]
```

5. Add, commit and push your code to GitHub.

6. Redeploy to Heroku.

### Add ALLOWED_HOSTS and CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV to settings.py

1. In settings.py, in the ALLOWED_HOSTS list, copy your ‘... .herokuapp.com’ string.
2. Log in to heroku.com and select your API application.
3. Click “settings”
4. Click “Reveal config vars”
5. Add the new key of ALLOWED_HOST with the value for your deployed Heroku application URL that we copied from settings.py
6. Back in settings.py, replace your ALLOWED HOSTS list '... .herokuapp.com' string we just copied with the ALLOWED_HOST environment variable.
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = [
    os.environ.get('ALLOWED_HOST'),
    'localhost',
]
```

In order to make our application more secure and accommodate the way Gitpod works by changing the workspace URL regularly, the below code has been provided for you to add to your project.

The following code works as follows:
a) When the CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV environment variable is defined, the unique part of your gitpod preview URL is extracted.
b) It is then included in the regular expression provided by us so that the gitpod workspace is still connected to our API when gitpod rotates the workspace URL.

1. Import the regular expression module at the top of your settings.py file. We will need this to manipulate the CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV URL string.
```
import re
```

2. Replace the else statement and body for `if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN' in os.environ:` with the following code:
```
if 'CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV' in os.environ:
    extracted_url = re.match(r'^.+-', os.environ.get('CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV', ''), re.IGNORECASE).group(0)
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN_REGEXES = [
        rf"{extracted_url}(eu|us)\d+\w\.gitpod\.io$",
    ]
```

3. Add, commit and push your changes.
